I suggest the node package \"http-server\".  You can install this using the following command.\r\n```\r\nnpm install http-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the http-server, you can run the app by navigating to directory in command-line and executing:\r\n```\r\nhttp-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now visit the application in your browser.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:8080\r\n```\r\n",
