In order to install the application you need to ensure you have npm installed.

### How do I get set up? ###

Clone the repository to your local directory and run the following command.

```
npm install
```

Then once all the dependencies are loaded, run the following command.

```
gulp default
```

To host the application.  I suggest the node package "http-server".  You can install this using the following command.
```
npm install http-server
```

Once you have installed the http-server, you can run the app by navigating to directory in command-line and executing:
```
http-server
```

You can now visit the application in your browser.

```
http://localhost:8080
```
